## Interpreting the Entity Relationship diagram

Here's an explanation of the diagram:

1. Entities: Each table in the database is represented as an entity (box) in the diagram.

2. Attributes: The attributes (columns) of each entity are listed within the entity box. The data type of each attribute is also specified.

3. Primary Keys: Primary keys are indicated with "PK" after the attribute name.

4. Foreign Keys: Foreign keys are indicated with "FK" after the attribute name.

5. Relationships: The lines between entities represent relationships. The symbols at the ends of these lines indicate the type of relationship:

   - `||--o{` means "one-to-many" relationship
   - For example, `BRANCH ||--o{ STAFF : employs` means one branch can employ many staff members

6. Relationship Labels: The text on the relationship lines describes the nature of the relationship (e.g., "employs", "owns", "views").
